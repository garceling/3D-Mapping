#Modify the following line with your own serial port details
#   Currently set COM3 as serial port at 115.2kbps 8N1
#   Refer to PySerial API for other options.  One option to consider is
#   the "timeout" - allowing the program to proceed if after a defined
#   timeout period.  The default = 0, which means wait forever.

import serial
s=serial.Serial('COM5', baudrate=115200, timeout=10)

print("Opening: " + s.name)

# reset the buffers of the UART port to delete the remaining data in the buffers
s.reset_output_buffer()
s.reset_input_buffer()

# wait for user's signal to start the program
input("Press Enter to start communication...")
# send the character 's' to MCU via UART
# This will signal MCU to start the transmission
s.write('s'.encode())
# recieve 32 measurements from UART of MCU, but i dont know what are the exact charcters i am being sent during each transimisison
for i in range(32):
    #this code means for that meausrment, keep on reaidng characters until u see hte \n in the sprintf line in keil
    x = s.readline()
    print(x.decode())
       
# the encode() and decode() function are needed to convert string to bytes
# because pyserial library functions work with type "bytes"


#close the port
print("Closing: " + s.name)
s.close()
